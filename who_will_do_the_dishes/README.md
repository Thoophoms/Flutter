# who_will_do_the_dishes

### Inspiration
This application was inspired by my family. We often left the dishes unwashed, with no one wanting to clean them. To solve this, I created **You Do Dishes**, an app that uses a fun and fair method to decide who does the dishes.

### How It Works
In **You Do Dishes** application, two dice are rolled randomly. The person who gets the higher number wins, and the one with the lower number has to do the dishes. It's a simple and entertaining way to resolve the chore dispute!

### Screenshots
