# Flutter

Flutter is a cross-platform UI software development toolkit created by Google to develop applications from a single codebase, which means that you can create apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web using the same code. It uses the Dart programming language, which is also developed by Google and is optimized for building mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

## Why Flutter?:

1. **Single Codebase:** You can write the code once and run it on multiple platforms.
2. **Fast Development:** While you are writing the code, you can quickly see the results in real-time.
3. **Expressive and Flexible UI:** Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and allows for highly customizable UIs.
4. **Native Performance:** Flutter applications are compiled directly to native ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) code to help achieve high performance on both iOS and Android.
5. **Strong Community Support:** Being an open-source UI toolkit, Flutter has a growing and active community that provides a wealth of resources, plugins, and packages.
